# DeepLearning
self project with using Tensorflow and Keras


Multi-class classification with image data and text data 

1. Image Data

- Classifying art images into their categories. 5 different categories
- Art images are collected from wikiart.com
- First implemented Keras deep learning model from scratch
- Second implemented Keras deep learning model using VGG16


'''
2. Text Data

- BBC news data classification. 5 different categories
- Implemented the model using BERT for pre-processing
- Used Lime tool to get the weighted features to see result
