# DeepLearning
Deep learning project with TensorFlow and Keras

## Disease detection project <br/>

From binary classification to multi-class classification<br/>
> Three different diseases <br/>
> (1) Brain tumor detection <br/>
> (2) Tooth decay detection <br/>
> (3) Lung cancer detection <br/> 



## Multi-class classification with image data and text data <br/>

**1. Image Data** <br/>

- Classifying art images into their categories. 5 different categories
- Art images are collected from wikiart.com
- First implemented Keras deep learning model from scratch
- Second implemented Keras deep learning model using VGG16

**2. Text Data** <br/>

- Classifying article text data into 5 different categories.
- Used text data from BBC.

  (1) Simple_text_classification.py
  - Used Keras pre-processing
  - Used Keras models
  
  (2) bbc_text_classification.py
  - Used BERT for pre-processing: Transfer Learning
  - Used Lime to show visual analysis for mis-classified texts
